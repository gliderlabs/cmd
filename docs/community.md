Community is hugely important for Cmd. Not only is it a community of users, but
as an open source project and service, it's also the community of developers and operators building and running Cmd.

As a community project of Glider Labs, the Cmd community is part of a larger
ecosystem of Glider Labs projects. We'd love to invite you into this community,
which is centered around our Slack.

Feel free to [join our Slack](http://slack.gliderlabs.com/) and find your way to the `#cmd` channel, but also
explore and see what else is going on. We're proud to be the preferred Slack
community of some really talented open source developers.
