# Comlab

Glider Labs app toolkit and development utility for component-oriented Go
applications.

Comlab gives you highly modularized, more reusable, and very extensible
application code. Our first priority is serving Glider Labs apps before making
this a general use project.

# Pre-release Install

We're not yet cutting releases of Comlab and its packages. To install the Comlab
CLI, clone the repo and:

```
$ make install
```

You'll need [Go](http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book/get_setup) and
[Glide](https://glide.sh/) installed, so perhaps run `brew bundle` first.

# Slack

Join [Glider Labs Slack](http://slack.gliderlabs.com/) and the `#comlab`
channel to talk about the project.
