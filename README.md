## Development

Development is optimized for OSX but you should be able to find equivalents
of everything for Linux and probably Windows.

### Dependencies

 * [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
 * [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) so you can `brew bundle` the rest
 * From here make sure your `GOPATH` is set
 * Minor utilities are installed with `make setup`
